Choose one of these options to work on now:

  # Make a class for a bank account.  It will store the number of dollars (euros) in the account.  It will have functions to add money, remove money.  Use locks to make sure the correct thing will happen if two threads try to add money or remove money at the same time.  Use the SameTimeAdd as an example to start.
  # Try adding more threads, maybe 5, or more, to one of the examples, and see if this changes how the program runs.
  # Using a thread that runs in the background, write a program that waits for the user to enter their name, while another thread counts in the background.  Often, you write programs where one thread waits for the user, and another thread opens a file, or does another piece of difficult work.
