  * Create a new Java project, and class, called *PortScanDemo*.
  * Add a main method to the class.
  * Now, add a loop, to go through the first 500 ports:
{{{
int port = 0;
while(port < 500)
{
try{

}
catch(Exception e)
{
System.out.println("Could not listen on port: " + port);
}
port = port + 1;
}
}}}
  * Inside the loop, we must make a new socket.  Use ServerSocket:
{{{
ServerSocket serverSocket = new ServerSocket(port);
}}}
After the *catch*, add a finally block:
{{{
finally{
	try {
		serverSocket.close();
	} catch (Exception e) {
	}
}
}}}
  * Try running the program.  Compare with the Wikipedia list of ports, why are some ports blocked?
