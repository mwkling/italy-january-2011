  * First, create a new java project.
  * Create a new class, named Morra, and put in the code below.  This is the basic code we used last time to make a window, so you can get started more easily.

{{{
import java.awt.Frame;
import java.awt.event.WindowAdapter;
import java.awt.event.WindowEvent;


public class Morra extends Frame {
	// Add variables here:

	public Morra(){
		super("Morra");
		this.setSize(400, 160);

		// Add code here:
		
		
		// If you do not have this code, you can not close
		// the window.
		this.addWindowListener(new WindowAdapter(){
			public void windowClosing(WindowEvent e){
				setVisible(false); dispose(); System.exit(0);
			}
		});
	}
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// Create and display the window
		Morra game = new Morra();
		game.setVisible(true);
	}

}
}}}

  * If you run the program now, you should see an empty window named Morra.
  * Now, we will add buttons and text to the Window.  We want to use a Grid to lay these out.  The grid has 4 rows and 4 columns.  To do this, we can add the code below to the constructor:
{{{
// The window will be a 4x4 grid
this.setLayout(new GridLayout(4,4));
}}}
  * Next, we start adding things to the grid.  They will be added from left to right, as shown:

  * First, add the labels on the top, for "Fingers", "Sum Guess", and "Score".  To add a label, you can use:
{{{
this.add(new Label("Label Name"));
}}}
