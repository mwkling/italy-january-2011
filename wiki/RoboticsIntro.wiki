==Part 1==
  * If you don't understand, use translate.google.com
  * Turn on the controller/robot. (accendere)
  * Move the arm, and open and close the hand.
  * Use the robot to pick something up, and move it somewhere else.
----
  * Now, you will start planning a program for the robot.
  * Pick a place for the robot to start.
  * Pick a place for the robot to end.
  * Write down each step in between.

Important positions need to be saved before using them in a program.


Below is an example, moving a block from PGET to PPUT.  At the end, the robot is at PWAIT.

{{{
10 MOV PWAIT
20 MOV PGET,+20
30 MVS PGET
40 HCLOSE 1
50 DLY 1.0
60 MVS PGET,+20
70 MOV PPUT,+20
80 MVS PPUT
90 HOPEN 1
100 DLY 1.0
110 MVS PPUT, +20
120 MOV PWAIT
130 END
}}}

Use this example program.  Then, write and implement a new program that moves something over a barrier.
