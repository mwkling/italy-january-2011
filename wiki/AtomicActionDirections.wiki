* Create a new Java Project, in Eclipse.
* Create 2 new classes, Start and AtomicAction.
* Put the code from the Wiki into these files.
* Run the program several times.  Are the results always the same?
* An 'X' appears when the values are not equal.  We want to change the program, so the values are always equal, and the 'X' does not appear.
* To do this, first add a 'lock' to the class AtomicAction.  It will be:
{{{
public static Object lock = new Object();
}}}
* Now, we can lock the code using the word "synchronize".  Around the code for reverse() and areEqual, add:
{{{
synchronized(lock){
// Code here...
}
}}}
* This means, if we call areEqual() in the middle of reverse(), we will wait until reverse() has finished.
* Run the program again, to see the new result.
