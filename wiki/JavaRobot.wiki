  * We can create a robot class to control the Mouse and Keyboard using Java.  Copy the following basic code into a new class called *RobotDemo*:

{{{
import java.awt.AWTException;
import java.awt.Robot;
import java.awt.event.InputEvent;
import java.awt.event.KeyEvent;


public class RobotDemo {
	static public void main(String[] args) throws Exception{
		Robot r = new Robot();
		
		r.mouseMove(10, 10);
	}
}
}}}

  * When you run the program, the mouse should move to the top corner of the screen.  Try moving the mouse somewhere else.
  * To click the mouse, use press and then release:
{{{
r.mousePress(InputEvent.BUTTON1_MASK);
r.mouseRelease(InputEvent.BUTTON1_MASK);
}}}
  * Change this to *BUTTON2_MASK* for Left click.
  * To press a key on the keyboard, use keyPress and keyRelease:
{{{
r.keyPress(KeyEvent.VK_ALT);
r.keyRelease(KeyEvent.VK_ALT);
}}}
  * You may need to pause in between key presses or mouse clicks if they are to fast.  To pause, use:
{{{
Thread.sleep(100);  // CHANGE the number to pause for longer.
}}}
  * Try writing a robot to do a useful task, like opening a file.
