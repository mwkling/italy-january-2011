This is a series of coding exericses I created for a month long teach program I did in Milan, Italy in 2011.
All of this was hosted on code.google.com until that was essentially shutdown.
Morra is a game played with fingers that we used as an example.

Exercises are varied and include:
 * simple python chat bot
 * threads in java
 * drawing shapes and simple gui elements in java
 * introduction to ping and traceroute
 * tic-tac-toe
 * pong
 * etc.
